create schedule, appointment, and appointment requests
get initial schedule and populate a new schedule object
While response is not 204 (do-while maybe)
    get appointment request from endpoint and add to list

Sort the list by order of appointment difficulty which is a measure of how many
    possible slots there are for that person
    dificulty calculation:
    if new, days * (2 - open slots for that day) * num of pref doctors
    else, days * (8 - open slots for that day) * num of pref doctors

loop through the sorted list and start to make appts on sched obj

when done, do api call for all new appts on sched obj
